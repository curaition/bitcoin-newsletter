1. **Clone and setup environment:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bitcoin_newsletter
```

2. **Install UV (if not already installed):**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies:**
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**
```bash
pre-commit install
```

5. **Configure environment variables:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
# Edit .env.development with your configuration
```

6. **Initialize database:**
```bash
