# Batch Processing & Newsletter Generation
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Executive Summary
A strategic implementation plan to process the existing article backlog through intelligent batch analysis and establish automated daily and weekly newsletter generation pipelines. This PRD builds on the existing sophisticated infrastructure to unlock the full potential of the crypto newsletter system.

  SELECT
    n.publication_date,
    n.title,
    n.synthesis_themes,
    n.pattern_insights,
