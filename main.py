"""
Celery entry point for Railway Celery services.

This module provides compatibility between Railway's expected 'main.app'
and our project's Celery app located at 'crypto_newsletter.shared.celery.app'.

Railway worker/beat services expect to import 'celery_main.app', so this file exposes our
configured Celery application instance.
